# MASTERING REACT  

## CONTEXT
In this repository, I intend to document my journey in learning react as a newbie, from basics and fundamentals components to the most advanced tasks. 

My reasons for starting this journey is because I have an upcoming project that requires full stack development skills, and I have decided on react as the best candidate for delivering good UI and UX to viewers. 

Learning and masterimh react is not easy, but I intend to achieve it in the shortest time possible to be able to use it as needed in my upcoming project.

## INTRODUCTION

**Briefly about myself**   
I am Julius Matheka Charles, and my journey in tech is a rather interesting one. 

I started off with a non-tech career, pursuing a degree in Disaster Management and International Diplomacy, before deciding that I was cut out for something else: a career in tech. 

My desire to transition introduced me to Machine Learning and I ended up pursuing Data Science Bootcamp, then Software Engineering one. Its been challenging but I dont want to bore you with life story, but rather focus on what's important here: react. 

In as much as I like working with things behind the scenes, I am also much interested in making things more appealing to the eyes, and react gives me the best platform to do that.

**What is ReactJS**  
If you are interested in adding very appealing front-end applications for your project, ReactJS is one of the ways to do so. 

Its not the only tool for such purpose, as there are others like VueJs, AngularJS, and NextJS among others. 

Its easier to think of it as a framework. However, [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-basics-concepts-complete-reference/) website considers ReactJS as a library, and not a framework, developed by Facebook to address specific challenges. 

Since its inception, this library has grown in popularity due to its ability to deliver good frontend applications
